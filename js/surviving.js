In the 1950s, demolition was seriously considered in favor of a traffic circle. The building was only saved by its masonry construction. City Hall remains standing simply because it was too expensive to tear down.",

				"description":"This is the story of a historical structure replaced by another building with historical merit which was then destroyed in order to replicate the original structure. Thomas Jefferson stayed with local bricklayer Jacob Graff in 1776 while drafting the Declaration of Independence. By the late 1800s, the home had fallen into disrepair and was knocked down by Penn National Bank. The bank commissioned Frank Furness who combined colonial nods with his signature style to produce a stylish and well loved building that, if existing today, would most likely have protected status. However, the bank left in the 1950s and the building fell into disrepair. In the 1970s the National Park Service decided to buy the land, destroy Furness' creation, and add a reproduction of the Declaration House to the Independence National Monument Park.",

The house currently has no historical designation, and may be threatened with the Philadelphia Housing Authority's massive - and controversial- plan to revitalize the impoverished Sharswood neighborhood over the next couple of years. The scope of the ambitious neighborhood transformation plan is too large to detail here, but criticisms by the Preservation Alliance and the Design Advocacy group have cited preservation as a particular concern with a plan of action that includes demolition by eminent domain. Other nearby historic sites, like old jazz clubs, are cause for concern among preservationists.",
