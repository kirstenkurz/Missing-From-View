			<h2 class="center">What of Philadelphia's Built Environment Should Be Preserved?</h2>
			<p class="center">Philadelphia is the U.S.' only UNESCO World Heritage City and boasts a wealth of historical structures that define a sense of place for residents and visitors. 
			Yet, each year, more examples of the city's architectural and cultural heritage fall victim to passive neglect or caustic development, eventually meeting the wrecking ball. 
			An offical designation by the city's Historical Commission can save a building's exterior from demolition unless structural failure is proven imminent and repairs prohibitively high.
			The cost of maintaining said structures can cause financial hardship for owners, who do not have to be included in the designation process and bear the onus of proving what 'prohibitively high' maintenance means
			-- a good or bad thing depending on the context or who is telling the story. </p>
			<p class="center">A city is not an edificial museum, but instead a collection of entities in flux, subject to the ever-changing needs of its constituent actors, who may yield their influence through power, wealth, or collective action.
			Financial capital is obviously integral in the outcomes of all cases. Lacking means for repairs may result in the demolition of a protected or otherwise structure, and high property values
			may spark interest in developing historical properties into new structures capable of producing greater financial gains. Still others would argue that preservation is a luxury concern; old buildings are expensive
			to maintain and therefore exist solely for those that can afford to do so. </br><b>Click anywhere on the screen</b> to access a map of some of Philadelphia's buildings that best exemplify the tension between perservation and change, and explore 
			how the distribution of these sites, demolished or standing, compares with median home values across Philadelphia. <i>(Photo: Demolition preceeding the 2007 Convention
