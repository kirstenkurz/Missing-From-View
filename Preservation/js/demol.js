				"description":"Love Park is a public space, yet the city has long taken issue with how some of the public chooses to use it. The park's concrete steps proved a perfect playground for skateboarders, and the location became enshrined in the global skate culture. The park was featured in skateboarding video games and was a catalyst for bringing the X Games to Philadelphia in 2001. The park's planner Edmund Bacon viewed the skaters favorably; they were using a public space in an inventive new way. However, the city has always held a different view, continuously escalating the fines for skating. As Love Park undergoes its renovation this year, the steps will be lost despite the intense devotion of a global subculture.",
